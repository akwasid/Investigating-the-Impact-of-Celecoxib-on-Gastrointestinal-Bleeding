Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like celecoxib. Understanding the factors that contribute to GI bleeding in patients taking celecoxib is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.In this study, we aim to assess the association between celecoxib use and GI bleeding in a cohort of 10,000 patients. We will employ propensity score matching (PSM) to account for potential confounding variables and obtain a more accurate estimate of the treatment effect.The dataset includes variables such as age, gender, history of GI bleeding, use of GI protective agents, warfarin use, number of medications used, and various comorbidities. By adjusting for these variables using PSM, we can compare the incidence of GI bleeding between patients taking celecoxib and those not taking it, while minimizing the effects of confounding factors.
